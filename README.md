### Note taker with Express

This application is used to store notes and retrieve them back when the user needs them. Also the user can delete them when ever and it all works with an express server.

This was a tough Homework, I like it when I get to make the whole program instead of using someone else's work. But I understand its more practical for when I get a job.
the app .delete was the hardest part made me have quite a fried brain just trying to think through even what to search. I had no idea what to google to find an answer. 

here is the video of it working.
